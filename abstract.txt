One key aspect of software development is feedback from users and beta- testers. This community is not always aware of the developments undertaken in the code base, neither they use the tools and practices followed by the developers to deal with a non-stable software in continuous evolution. The open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy Gammapy, provides its beta-tester user community with ver- sioned reproducible environments and executable documentation, in the form of Jupyter notebooks tutorials and virtual environments technologies that are versioned coupled with the code base. We believe this set-up greatly improves the user experience for a software in prototyping phase, as well as providing a good workflow to maintain an up-to-date documentation.
