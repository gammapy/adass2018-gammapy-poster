One key aspect of software development is feedback from users and beta-testers. This community is not always aware of the
developments undertaken in the code base, neither they use the tools and practices followed by the developers to deal with
a non-stable software in continuous evolution. The open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy Gammapy, provides 
its beta-tester user community with versioned reproducible environments and executable documentation, in the form of Jupyter
notebooks tutorials and virtual environments technologies that are versioned coupled with the code base. We believe this 
set-up greatly improves the user experience for a software in prototyping phase, as well as providing an up-to-date
documentation and a good workflow for developers.
